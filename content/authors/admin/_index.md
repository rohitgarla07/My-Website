As a Data Science aspirant with years of academic experience in programming,
I have mastered the ins and outs of data engineering techniques. After honing and
executing these specialties to reach numerous academic goals, I was honored a masters
degree in Computer Science. Now, I spend the majority of my time brainstorming programming
techniques on leet code and building apps using swift.
